I am a technology passionate who really likes learning new things and be up to date on new technology trends. I'd say that I have the luck of working in something I believe: through innovation and continuous development we can help people have better lives!

I have been involved in App development since my university studies, back in 2011, where I developed an environment for having a near-real time app for tracking the internal bus service inside the university campus, for Android devices. 

I have worked for companies in Spain and England, where I lived for a bit longer than two years, on quite a different set of apps: for buying concert tickets, online streaming tv service, passenger information for railway travellers, remote control of HI-FI equipment, for helping companies help their services, online fashion shops, among others.

A few months back, I decided to come back to the origin: Tenerife, where I have established myself as a freelance developer, and volunteered on social projects through [SocialCoder](www.socialcoder.org).

If you like my posts, you need my help figuring out how to fix a specific problem or you would like to contract me to help developing your project, do not hesitate to contact me through my email or Linkedin. I am here to help you.
